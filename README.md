## Overview
This game is called "towerDefense: the Tower Defense game". It's a tower defense game where you play as the greedy towers trying to hinder to oncoming ellipse hordes. The more money you have, the faster the ellipses are. Ellipses get stronger as time goes on, so you better start upgrading your towers!
## Instructions
1) Start the Game</br>
2) In order to place towers, click on the 4 different options on the top right. If you try to place a tower on the board, you will see the range.</br>
3) If you would like to place a tower on the board, click on the tower you want(make sure you have enough money to afford it), and then click on the tile you want to put it on. Please note that you can only place towers on green tiles.</br>
4) To upgrade a tower, click on the upgrade button, then click on the tower you would like to upgrade. You can then upgrade its range (increases the range of which the tower can see and shoot enemies), its damage (increases bullet damage/speed/accuracy), and its reload speed (Allows the tower to shoot more times per second). The cost will depend on the type of upgrade and the number of times you've already upgraded the tower. These upgrades are different based on the type of tower, and some towers upgrade higher than others in their respective category.</br>
5) Press space to start the round!</br>
6) If you would like the enemies to spawn faster throughout a wave, press and hold ','. In order to slow them down, press and hold '.' (This works by spawning each enemy 1 frame closer together or further apart, starting at a 50 frame distance)</br>
7) Killing enemies, starting a round, and pressing 'm' will earn you money. Each enemy killed earns $15, starting a round earns $500, and pressing 'm' gives you $750. If you press 'l', you will lose $500 until you reach 0.</br>
8) If you would like to give up, press 'e'. If you would like to cover your board in powerful base towers, press '\\'.</br>
9) You win if you survive to past round 10. The game will restart once you do!</br>
10) You lose if you let enough enemies through the gates. This is only possible during round 4 or later. When an enemy reaches the end of the path, you lose lives based on how much HP that enemy has left. Enemies' HP is increased by 1 during every even round, excluding round 2.</br>
</br>
Good luck!
